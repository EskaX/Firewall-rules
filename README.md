# Firewall-rules
These are my iptable rules that I use for my vpn's ddos protection. Keep in mind that some of the iptables are outdated. and might not be the best for you. So dont rely on me for YOUR vpn's ddos protection




all the iptable rules are in "Iptables"
==========================================

if you dont understand how to input them than you can use the tables-setup.py script I put in the Repo
========================================================================================================

also if you need help setting the vpn up with pritunl than you can refer to the vpn.sh script i put in the repo aswell
============================================================================================================================

if you want to check incoming traffic then you can use the command i put in the repo as well "patch.txt
==========================================================================================================

"i also put a couple extra scripts like
"Dump.sh" --> will automatically tcp dump when detecting irregular large incomming traffic
=============================================================================================================================================================================
if you need extra help than you can refer to RyCourvix' github for more help on how to utilize iptables
==========================================================================================================

Thanks  :)
